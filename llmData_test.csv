BLUELAND is a make-believe country. REDLAND is another make-believe country, an enemy of BLUELAND. 

Write me a training scenario for an air strike mission by BLUELAND to destroy a specified target. This scenario will be given to BLUELAND, who will devise a strategy to execute the plan. The scenario should be non-descriptive, concise and factual. The information should be sufficient to help BLUELAND to decide their loadout and strategy. The scenario should include the following information about the target and REDLAND: 
1.	Commander’s Intent: Captures the broad mission objectives (eg: 100% TOT, 50% BLUELAND losses, 100% REDLAND destruction, destroy bunkers, etc)
2.	Force Composition: REDLAND’s units and objects participating in the scenario, Order of Battle, i.e the identification, strength, command structure, disposition for the personnel, units, equipment of any military force, command & control hierarchies, communication networks and communication channels. This should be specific, i.e exact model of aircraft or missiles (eg: F-15 fighter jets, SA-7 surface-to-air missile launchers, ZSU-23-4 Shilka self-propelled anti-aircraft gun systems, etc). 
3.	Geography: Distance to target and distance to REDLAND threats  in nautical miles (nm). Specification of environmental conditions which are of interest (eg: day/night/dawn, buildings, vegetation, ditches in surroundings, etc) 
4.	Surrounding Conditions: Overview of all scenario-related information of interest, i.e surrounding military situation, REDLAND readiness state, etc.
5.	Target(s) Details:  Any relevant information about target(s), i.e type and number of targets. 
6.	Rules of Engagement: Directives that outline when and how BLUELAND can engage hostile forces.<end_of_turn>

BLUELAND is a make-believe country. REDLAND is another make-believe country, an enemy of BLUELAND. 

Write me a training scenario for an air strike mission by BLUELAND to destroy a specified target. This scenario will be given to BLUELAND, who will devise a strategy to execute the plan. The scenario should be non-descriptive, concise and factual. The information should be sufficient to help BLUELAND to decide their loadout and strategy. The scenario should include the following information about the target and REDLAND: 
1.	Commander’s Intent: Captures the broad mission objectives (eg: 100% TOT, 50% BLUELAND losses, 100% REDLAND destruction, destroy bunkers, etc)
